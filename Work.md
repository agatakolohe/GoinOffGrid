Feedback:

- Privacy: Protecting personal information from ill-intention users
- Information logging: car details, location, leave time, estimated return time
- Rescue: Specific agencies in the area, ie sheriff, rangers, SAR. Automatic call 2 hours after expected return.
- GPS tracking
- Simple: entries for location, leave time, estimated return time, and a time to call authorities if not returned by \_\_.
- Advanced: automatic fill in of numbers for specific agencies in the area who need to be informed if not returned by time (local sheriff and ranger station numbers) so the person doesnâ€™t have to research; gps tracking.
- 2 hours after that time has expired a call is placed out from authorities to that person to verify if they are back or not. If they are not they send out search teams.
