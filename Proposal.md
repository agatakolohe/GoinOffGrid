### GoinOffGrid

#### Description

GoinOffGrid is an 'accountabilibuddy'/accountability app for hikers to share their location, supplies and duration of hike with an emergency contact (accountabilibuddy). The goal is to have a chosen contact be aware and accountable of the hiker's adventure and safe return.

#### Use Case

- Users are primarily hikes who are hiking alone. The unspoken rule when solo hiking is to let one person (emergency contact) know where you are going, in case something were to happen (weather change, natural disaster, health comlications, getting lost, stranger danger, car trouble). The difficulty is organizing all the important information the hiker should share with their emergency contact. (location, duration, supplies, conditions). This has resulted in missing hikers, stressful encounters and general anxiety of solo hiking of being "off the grid" instead of enjoying the experience of being off grid, of disconnecting from the daily grind and enjoying solitude in nature.

- The product will provide a form for the user to input the hike information they are wanting to share with their emergency contact.

- The product will inform the hiker's emergency contact with the form information submitted via email.

- The product will allow the user to log when they have completed their hike and safely returned.

- The product will inform the hiker's emergency contact that the hiker has completed their hike and safely returned.

- The project will have a timer for the duration of user's the hike.

- The product will notify the hiker's emergency contact if the hiker has not logged their return and provide instructions to ensure the hiker is safe. (Instruct emergency contact to contact the hiker, contact the authorities if suspected that the hiker may be in danger or missing).

- The product will allow users/contacts to alleviate the stress of solo hiking.
